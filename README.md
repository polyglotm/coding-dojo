Sometimes I enjoyed solving algorithm problem. cause it feels like making my brain smarter.
when I first time learned heap-sort it was shocking. I could not imagine making such an algorithm. anyway 
I learned a few programming languages ​​and want to solve them by comparing the languages.
such as Java, Javascript. this project is for organizing thought of my think.
